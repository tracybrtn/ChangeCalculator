# Change Calculator

## Description

Command-line interface Python program that calculates the amount of change that a given user has available to them.

### User Story

### Acceptance Criteria

a) Develop the money calculating program discussed below using a command line interface
b) The program should use a function to request, obtain and validate the input values for each coin type 
(specifically, the coin counts must be non-negative values)
c) The ‘getCoin’ function (step b) should include a try/except block so that illegal (i.e., non-integer) data does 
not crash the program
d) Include a loop in the main process so that the user may enter different sets of coins (i.e., be able to run the 
calculation multiple times)
e) Include a final total that displays after the user is finished; this will display the total of all amounts entered 
throughout the session (i.e., all loop iterations)
